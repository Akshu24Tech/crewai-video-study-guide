# 🚀 CrewAI Video Study Guide - Deployment Guide

## ✅ Deployment Structure Fixed

Your project now has the correct CrewAI deployment structure:

```
crewai-video-study-guide/
├── pyproject.toml                    # ✅ Required by CrewAI
├── src/
│   ├── crew.py                       # ✅ Required entry point
│   └── crewai_video_study_guide/
│       ├── crew.py                   # ✅ Main crew definition
│       ├── config/
│       │   ├── agents.yaml           # ✅ Agent configurations
│       │   └── tasks.yaml            # ✅ Task definitions
│       └── tools/
│           └── video_tools.py        # ✅ Video processing tools
├── requirements.txt                  # ✅ Dependencies
├── .env                             # ✅ Environment variables
└── Dockerfile                       # ✅ Container deployment
```

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

The original error occurred because:
- ❌ Missing `pyproject.toml` 
- ❌ Missing `src/crew.py`
- ❌ Wrong project structure

Now you have:
- ✅ Proper `pyproject.toml` with CrewAI configuration
- ✅ Correct `src/crew.py` entry point
- ✅ Standard CrewAI project structure
- ✅ YAML configuration files for agents and tasks
- ✅ Proper package imports

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: CrewAI Cloud (Recommended)
```bash
# Install CrewAI CLI
pip install crewai

# Deploy to CrewAI Cloud
crewai deploy
```

### Option 2: Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build the container
docker build -t crewai-video-study-guide .

# Run the container
docker run -e GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key crewai-video-study-guide
```

### Option 3: Traditional Python Deployment
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the crew
python src/crew.py
```

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your deployment environment:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here  # Optional
CREWAI_TRACING_ENABLED=true              # Optional
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Deployment

Run this to validate everything is working:

```bash
python validate_structure.py
```

## 📝 Both Versions Work

You now have two working versions:

1. **New CrewAI Structure** (for deployment):
   ```bash
   python src/crew.py
   ```

2. **Original Script** (still works locally):
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add CrewAI deployment structure"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deploy using your preferred method** (see options above)

3. **Set environment variables** in your deployment platform

4. **Test the deployment** with a sample video URL

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:

1. **Check the logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Ensure all dependencies** are installed
4. **Check file permissions** in the deployment environment

Your project is now properly structured for CrewAI deployment! 🎉
