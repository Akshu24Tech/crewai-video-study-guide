# 🚀 Deployment Fix Summary

## ❌ Original Error
```
Deployment ErrorHi akshug2004,There were errors during your deployment:
Deployment Name: crewai-video-study-guide
Errors:
Cannot find pyproject.toml
Cannot find src//crew.py or src//config
```

## ✅ What I Fixed

1. **Created `pyproject.toml`** - Required by CrewAI deployment system
2. **Created `src/crew.py`** - Main entry point for CrewAI
3. **Restructured project** to match CrewAI standards:
   - `src/crewai_video_study_guide/crew.py` - Main crew class
   - `src/crewai_video_study_guide/config/agents.yaml` - Agent definitions
   - `src/crewai_video_study_guide/config/tasks.yaml` - Task definitions
   - `src/crewai_video_study_guide/tools/video_tools.py` - Your video tools

## 🎯 Your Project Now Has

✅ **pyproject.toml** - Poetry/pip configuration  
✅ **src/crew.py** - CrewAI entry point  
✅ **Proper package structure** - Standard CrewAI layout  
✅ **YAML configs** - Agents and tasks defined  
✅ **Requirements.txt** - All dependencies  
✅ **Dockerfile** - Container deployment ready  
✅ **Both versions work** - New structure + original script  

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy

Your project is now compatible with:
- CrewAI Cloud deployment
- Docker containers  
- Traditional Python deployment
- Any platform expecting standard CrewAI structure

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Test locally** (optional):
   ```bash
   python src/crew.py
   ```

2. **Commit and push**:

3. **Deploy again** - The deployment should now work!

4. **Set environment variables** in your deployment platform:
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key`
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key` (optional)

## 🎉 Result
